# About DevOps Insights
{: #insights_about}

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} comprises several groups of capabilities:

   * Developer Insights provides a comprehensive way to explore your projectâ€™s development maturity. You can identify files with high error proneness and get a compliance view of the project against developer practices.

   * Team uses social coding analysis to help you learn how your team collaborates and understand how it can work better.

   * Deployment Risk is like a safety net for continuous delivery. It analyzes the results from unit tests, functional tests, security scans, application scans, and code coverage tools at specified gates in your deployment process and prevents risky changes from being released. It shows charts of trends in code coverage, builds and deployments.  

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} is an integration in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} open toolchain catalog. For more information about toolchains, see [Working with toolchains](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains_working.html).

In addition, IBM runs Developer Insights and Team against many of the most successful open sources projects on GitHub. Go to [DevOpsInsights.io](http://devopsinsights.io/) to see their development and team data.
