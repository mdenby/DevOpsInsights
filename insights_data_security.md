# Securing your data    
{: #insights_data_security}  

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} hosts your databases in a highly available and secure environment:
   * Data is encrypted at rest (GPFS, LUKS, and Softlayer) and in flight (HTTPS and SSH). Client and system credentials are stored on encrypted disks.
   * Access to data is limited to only those users who require the data to support and maintain the service.
